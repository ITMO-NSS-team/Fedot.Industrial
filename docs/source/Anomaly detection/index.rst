Welcome to Anomaly detection module's documentation!
============================================

.. container::


Here you can find comprehensive documentation for the
`FEDOT.Industrial framework <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/Fedot.Industrial>`__.

FEDOT.Industrial is a framework for automated machine learning. It provides
a set of tools for solving several problems related to time series:
anomaly detection, classification, change point detection, and object detection.

The framework is based on the FEDOT_ framework using its algorithmic
kernel in terms of evolutionary optimization and obtaining graph-like
pipelines for classification.
