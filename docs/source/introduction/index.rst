Introduction to Framework
=========================

FEDOT.Industrial is a Python-based open-source framework for automated machine learning.
It is designed to solve complex real-world problems with a minimum of human
intervention. Among this problems are:

**Time series classification**

Here we use a generators, set of basis functions or their combination in the form
of pipeline to transform time series into a feature space. Then we use capabilities
of FEDOT framework to train classification model.

**Anomaly detection**

.. note::
    This functionality is under development.

**Object detection**

**Object classification**
