FEDOT.Industrial is a Python-based open-source framework for automated machine learning.
It is designed to solve complex real-world problems with a minimum of human
intervention. Among this problems are:

**Time series classification**

Here we use a combination of feature generators and light-weight machine learning
models to obtain results which are comparable to the state-of-the-art
approaches.

**Anomaly detection**

**Change point detection**

**Object detection**
