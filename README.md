Instead of using complex and resource-demanding deep learning techniques, which could be considered state-of-the-art
solutions, we propose using a combination of feature extractors with an ensemble of lightweight models obtained by the
algorithmic kernel of [**AutoML framework FEDOT.**](https://github.com/nccr-itmo/FEDOT)

Application field of the framework is the following:

### Classification (time series or image)

For this purpose we have developed four feature
generators: spectral, quantile, wavelet and topological.

### Anomaly detection (time series or image)

### Change point detection (only time series)

*--work in progress--*

### Object detection (only image)

*--work in progress--*

# Usage
